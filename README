This basic service uses the following technologies:
spring
jsp/tiles 2+jstl
jquery
jqueryui
cloudbees
mongodb
sendgrid
ajax
ESAPI + APPSENSOR

And can do the following:
Show a couple of web pages which have no real content BUT:
1. Lets you register and login
2. Send confirmation email to confirm registration
3. Select a language (English/Hebrew) and display accordingly (meaning right-to-left and left-to-right behavior is handled, email is sent in the right language)
4. Lets you display configurable dialogs and act according to dialog result
5. Uses spring and tiles2 and lets you manage jsp fragments to have unified page visuals
6. Uses ESAPI for input validation and intrusion detection
7. Saves and gets objects to/from mongodb, while preserving a stateless service which can grow indefinitely
8. More inside

I'll work to add more (for example, unit testing is not done yet), but this should be a giant leap for anyone starting from scratch.

Enjoy!
